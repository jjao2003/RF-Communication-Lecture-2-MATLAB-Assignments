# RF Communication - Lecture 2 MATLAB Assignments

**Student:** Agozie Joel Onuigbo
**Student ID:** IT23SP
**Course:** Wireless and Radio Tech. (IT-IoT BSc)
**Lecture:** 2 - Signals, Filtering, Modulation

## Contents
* **A1:** Time domain + frequency domain (FFT) analysis of a multi-tone signal.
* **A2:** Filtering to isolate desired frequency components (500Hz, 800Hz, 600Hz, and 700/800Hz).
* **A3:** Basic modulation (frequency translation idea) shifting baseband to passband.

## How to run
Open MATLAB, go to the specific assignment folder (e.g., `A1_time_frequency`), and run the `.m` file.

## Notes
All plots have been exported as PNG using `exportgraphics` at 200 DPI as required.
